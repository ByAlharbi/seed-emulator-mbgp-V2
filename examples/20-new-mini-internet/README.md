# New Mini Internet

This folder actually contains several examples. 
We use it to demonstrate several features of the emulator. 
It combines the demonstration from several examples. 
We first run `20-base-only.py` to generate the base component.
Then we use it as the basis for other examples. 
Each example is placed in a sub folder.

- `add-new-base-elements`: this example demonstrates how to 
  add new elements on top of the base component, such as IX, AS, 
  adding a new router to an existing AS, etc.

- `dns-elements`: add a DNS infrastructure to the base component

- `dns-component`: create a DNS infrastructure as a component first, and then
   plug this component into the base component.
