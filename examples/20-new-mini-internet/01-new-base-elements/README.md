# Add New Base Component

This example shows how to add new various base components to an existing 
base component. We would like to demonstrate the followings:

- Add new internet exchange, new autonomous systems, 

- Create a new PoP in the new internet exchange for an existing AS. This 
  involves adding a new BGP router and a new internet network to this AS.

- Create peering among the new and existing ASes. 
  - public peering using `RS`
  - private peering
