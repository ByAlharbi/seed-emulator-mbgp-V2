# Internet Service Provider
In this example, we show how the SEED Emulator to emulate the
Internet Service Provider that provides the Internet service 
to home (such as Spectrum). The scenario is described in the 
diagram as below.

## Physical Devices Installation Example

## Step 1) Deploy a dhcp server
```
# Create a DHCP server (virtual node).
dhcp = DHCPService()

# Default DhcpIpRange : x.x.x.101 ~ x.x.x.120
# Set DhcpIpRange : x.x.x.125 ~ x.x.x.140
dhcp.install('dhcp-01').setIpRange(125, 140)

# Customize the display name (for visualization purpose)
emu.getVirtualNode('dhcp-01').setDisplayName('DHCP Server')

# Create new host in AS-151, use it to host the DHCP server.
# We can also host it on an existing node.
as151 = base.getAutonomousSystem(151)
as151.createHost('dhcp-server').joinNetwork('net0')
```

## Step 2) Add a Hostâ€™s physical interface to the bridge

### Run bridge.sh

```
usage: ./bridge.sh -i {interface} -a {ASN}
```

You can get the interface name through `ip -br addr | grep -vE 'veth|br'` command.
This command will show you network interfaces name without `veth` or `br`.

In this example, the physical interface name that I use is `enx00e04cadd82a`. And the ASN that I use is 151 as I installed the dhcp server at asn-151.
So the command will be as below.

` ./bridge.sh -i enx00e04cadd82a -a 151`

Once the phyical network interface is bridged to the docker's bridge interface, DHCP server inside the emulator will assign the ip to the Wifi Accesspoint. Once you connect to the Wifi from the Phyisical Devices, the devices can connect (ping or visit webpages) to the hosts inside the emulators.
