# Nano Internet 

In this example, we build a very small Internet to demonstrate 
some of the features of the emulator. We will have a YouTube
video to explain this example, so we will not explain it 
here. The YouTube video link will be added later. The following
features are demonstrated in this example:

- Creating internet exchange 
- Creating transit and stub AS
- Using utility function to create AS
- Node customization
- BGP peering
- Install web service on nodes
- Binding virtual nodes to physical nodes
- Compilation
