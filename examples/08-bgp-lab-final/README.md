# seedemu: the BGP lab

This emulator re-creates the topology as described in the final task in the [SEED BGP lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Networking/BGP/BGP_Basic/). This document assumes the reader has some idea of what each layer does - it will be better to go through the other examples before proceeding with this one.
