# Deploy contract

Smart contract deployment has to be done at the run time, instead
of the build time. In this example, we show how to 
set up the contract deployment at the build time, so when the emulator
starts, the contract can be automatically deployed.

- Using the genesis block
- Using the init-and-info server.
