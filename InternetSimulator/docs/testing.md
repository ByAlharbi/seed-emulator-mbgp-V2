# Automatic Testing


We need to build the testing into our simulator, so we can conduct automatic testing. One way to do that is to add a ```autoTesting()``` API to each class. We will use this document to discuss how we are going to implement the auto testing functionality. We do not have a design yet, so it is not just about implementing this API. The discussion should focus on how to do the testing.
