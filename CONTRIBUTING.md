# Contributing to SEEDEmulator Project

Thanks for checking out the SEEDEmulator project! We're excited to hear and
learn from you. We've put together the following guidelines to help you
figure out where you can best be helpful.

## How to Contribute

- **Adding new elements**. We will be actively developing new elements 
  useful for Internet emulation. For example, recently we have added
  DNS, Botnet, Darknet components, and we are currently developing blockchain
  components. It is these components that will make the emulator 
  more interesting and more useful. 

- **Improving existing elements**: Some of the elements are currently quite rudimentary, and 
  rich features need to be added. You can help us propose and implement 
  new features to those elements. 

- **Building more complicated emulation**: The Internet emulators built by the 
  current examples included in the project are quite small. It will be useful if we can build
  more complicated examples, and share them as components, so others
  can use these components to build their emulators. In the future, we can
  create a market place so people can share or trade their emulators. 

- **Testing**. We definitely need more people to help test 
  the code and provide feedback. You can create issues to tell us
  about the bugs and feedback.
    
- **Developing lab exercises**. The emulator created from this project is 
  intended for being used as a platform for lab exercises, especially in
  the field of cybersecurity and networking. You can help 

  - *Yesterday-Once-More Labs*: recreating those interesting cybersecurity incidents
    happened in the past, so we can take students back to the past to experience, 
    participate, or even change the "history". 
  - *Blockchain and Smart Contract Lab*: we can deploy a customized blockchain
    inside an emulator, and design labs to attack smart contract.
  - *Morris Worm Lab*: recreate the Morris Worm, and see release it inside the emulator.
    We do need to install vulnerable software on all the nodes. 
  - *BGP Attack Lab*  
  - *Botnet Lab*
  - *Darknet Lab*
