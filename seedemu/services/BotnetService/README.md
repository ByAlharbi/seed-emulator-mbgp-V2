### Botnet Service

 - In config folder, the `payload.txt` file and `stager.txt` file is used for deploying into bot server. In order to communicate with C2 server.
 - these two data files may cause Trojan detection because it contains some of malicious code. Need to be pay attention when upload it to PIP.
