# Building the Ecosystem 


Building a realistic simulation takes time. It will be great if people
can share what they build. For example, if somebody painstakingly builds
a simulation for a small regional network, and is willing to share, we should
make it easy for people to do that. We do need to think about how to 
build such an ecosystem, where people can build, share, and adopt simulations.
We will use this document to record our thinkings.
