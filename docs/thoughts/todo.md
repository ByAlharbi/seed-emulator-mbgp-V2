# TODO List

This document lists some of the features that we should consider
in our future release


## Core 

- Service: add `getVNodes` API, so we can get a list of all the 
  vnodes (names) added to a service. 


## Service



## Blockchain

- Every time I run the D00 example, the program will generate the accounts,
  which takes a long time. Is it possible to provide an option to save the 
  accounts in a local folder (cache), and allow the programs to directly
  load them from the cache, instead of regenerating them.
