Notes

- The EtcHosts layer should be automatically added. During the rendering,
  if this layer is not there, create a new one and add it. If such a layer
  already exists, there is no need to add. 

- `node.md`: still empty

- `compiler.md`: The content for Docker compiler should be more. Although
  some of the content is in the overall document, here, we should add 
  more details.
