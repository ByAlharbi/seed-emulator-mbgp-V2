# SEED Internet Emulator: Components and Advanced Features

## Advanced Features 

  - [Connect to the real world](../bgp.md#connect-to-realworld): set up the BGP routing
    so the nodes inside the emulator can communicate with the real Internet. 
  - [Allow outside machines to join the emulation](../../../examples/A03-real-world/)
  - [Support Apple Silicon machines (arm64)](../docker.md#platform): generate emulator
    files for Apple Silicon machines. 
  - [Hybrid Emulation 1: including physical devices](../../../examples/C03-bring-your-own-internet/)
  - [Hybrid Emulation 2: including virtual devices running on QEMU](../../../examples/)


## Components

  - [Build DNS Infrastructure](../../../examples/B01-dns-component/) and
    [Add DNS to Emulator](../../examples/B02-mini-internet-with-dns)  
  - [IP anycast](../../../examples/B03-ip-anycast/)
  - [DHCP server](../../../examples/B10-dhcp/)
  - [Darknet (Tor)](../../../examples/B07-darknet-tor/)
  - [Botnet](../../../examples/B05-botnet/)
  - [The Hosts file (add IP-hostname mappings)](../../../examples/B11-etc-hosts/): 
    inside the emulator, we add ip-hostname mappings to the `/etc/hosts` file. 
  - [Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)](../../../examples/)
  - [IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)](../../../examples/)
