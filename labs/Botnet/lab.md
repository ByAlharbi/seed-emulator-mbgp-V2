# Botnet Lab


## Background: Brief Introduction of boyd 

Give a brief introduction of boyd and botnet in general. 


## Overview of the Underlying Emulator

The lab will be based on a pre-built emulator that we 
provide. Here we will introduce this emulator, showing 
students what are included. We will not write this part now, 
as we haven't finalized what pre-built emulator 
we are going to use. 


## Task 1. Deploying Basic Botnet

We will deploy a simple Botnet in this task. It should 
have at least 5 bots. The base emulator will be provided,
so students only need to deploy the botnet on the provided 
emulator. 

 - Show students how to deploy Botnet in our emulator. 
   Can reuse the design document. 

 - Design activities to help students understand how
   Botnet works.


## Task 2. Launching Attacks Using Botnet

 - Design activities to help students use the Botnet
   in attacks. For example, launch a DDoS attack. 

 - Let's try to find 2-3 interesting things to do here.


## Task 3. Writing Your Own Programs

 - Ask students to write their own program, and push it to 
   each bot. Use a skeleton code to show students how 
   to write such a code. 


## Task 4. Evading Firewalls

Add DGA to the Botnet to make it more difficult to block. 
We will also change the IP address of the command & control.
