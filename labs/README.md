# Labs Based on Internet Emulator

The objective of this project is two-fold: (1) create education-oriented 
Internet emulators, and (2) develop hands-on lab exercises based on the emulators. 
The needs from these labs will also help drive the development of the 
emulator. This folder hold the labs developed from this project.
We welcome contribution from the community.

In this document, we provide some initial lab ideas that could benefit from the emulators. 
New ideas are welcome and they will constantly be added to this wish list. 

## BGP Related Labs 

These will be a series of labs that help students understand 
how BGP works and how it can be attacked. It can be used for teaching the 
following:

- How BGP works in the real world
- How IP anycast and multicast works  
- BGP attacks: Network prefix hijacking

## Yesterday-Once-More Labs 

These labs will recreate interesting cybersecurity 
incidents happened in the past, including attacks, mistakes, and disasters.  
We would like to take students back to the past to experience, observe,
or even change the "history". These will be a series of labs,
one for each past incident. Here is the list of ideas:

- *Morris Worm*: Recreating the Morris Worm, and release it inside the emulator.
   We do need to recreate those involved vulnerable programs and install them
   on all the nodes inside the emulator. 
- *Pakistan's Hijacking of YouTube*:  
- *Turkey's Hijacking of Global DNS*:  
- *Syria's Self Isolation from the Internet*:

## Blockchain and Smart Contract Labs

We are currently implement the Blockchain service. Using this service, 
we can build a blockchain component, which is essentially an overlay network 
with the nodes running the Ethereum software. This example demonstrates
how the needs for lab development can drive the development of the Emulator software.

Once a component is built, it can be deployed inside an emulator, so we can have a blockchain
running inside our emulator. This blockchain will then become the platform
for lab exercises. It can be used for teaching the following:

- How blockchain works 
- How smart contract works 
- Common vulnerabilities in smart contract applications
